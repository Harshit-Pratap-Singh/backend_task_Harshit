What is WebSockets?
</h1>

<p>
Websockets are used to create bidirectional connection unlike http in which connection is based on request and response.
The bi-directional connection means that the it is not nessesary to create a request to recieve a response rather server can respond independently and also the connection reamins until closed , and this is why it is used for real time commmunication.
